My name is Louise and I am a student from AgroParisTech in France. I have been following courses about health and biomedicals issues as well as environment.
I have decided to specialize in data analyses for my last year Master.
I had the opportunity to work on several projects, such as the simulation of an epidemic (with Python and R). Also, I have been in an internship at the Pasteur institute for 6 months in 2021 where I worked on imaging data and genetic data.
